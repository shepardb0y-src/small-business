My app is called the small business because I wouild like keep building on this project as a small business application template for small business owners. The technologies used for this project are React, styled components, react-icons, @mui/icons, react-router-dom and axios. While making this project I had to think about the UX for my client and users so I thought about differnt use cases of the application. This application will be used by two types of users. The first will be the user who is looking to purchase a certain service from my client. The second user is my client reading the data from my users and keeping track of the clients who have viewed the user data. With this in my application I will accomplish the goal of organizing user service interest and allowing the client to recieve the data to reach back out to the user.

My application comes witha few features I have a user authentication represented by useContext so the client can log in and out. I have made a image carousel to view past work done by the client. Also there is a form for users to fill out which job they would like and how to reach the user.

In the futer i would like to add the optin for the user to change the price details and services they offer to user on thier own.
